The Semiconductor Industry Association issued a [press release](http://www.sia-online.org/cs/papers_publications/press_release_detail?pressrelease.id=1587) that the sales for semiconductors in March rose to 14.7 billion USD from 14.2 billion USD, the month before.

One of the possible reasons it comments is that, chip buyers have used up their inventories. Well if that is true, it bodes well for the IT industry in general. You need software to power all those extra chips, and bandwidth to connect them. Let's hope it keeps going up.
