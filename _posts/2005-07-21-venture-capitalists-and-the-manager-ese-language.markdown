A great [post](http://www.venchar.com/2005/04/hustle_passion_.html) by  [Narasimha Chari](http://www.venchar.com/), underlines something that I had suspected all along - the standard VC questionaire on "barriers-to-entry", "competition-space" and other manager-ese lingo is plain marketing. If you can maintain a straight face and confidence when faced with these, then it can be handled. Ultimately, no one knows if a venture will succeed or fail (who would have bet on iPod and how many did'nt on Webvan), but do you have the passion, hustle (a-ha!!) and resiliency to.
