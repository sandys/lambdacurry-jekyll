ahh.. seems I originated a new law. In response to this [article's](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/oracle-rebrands-java-breaks-eclipse/2012) comment which states:


<blockquote>"Who fixes a bug by making something dependent on the dll/exe company name? Stupid...How are those outsourced indians working for you now Oracle and Sun!!!!"</blockquote>


I postulate thusly


<blockquote>_**As an online discussion about PROGRAMMING grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving outsourcing or Indians approaches 1, if [Godwin's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law) has not already been satisfied**_</blockquote>


It is an honest attempt at reducing the **_reduction ad outsourcedum _arguments that seem to be getting more popular.**
