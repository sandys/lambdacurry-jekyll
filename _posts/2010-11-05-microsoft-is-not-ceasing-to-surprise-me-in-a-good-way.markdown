F# has been [released ](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2010/11/04/announcing-the-f-compiler-library-source-code-drop.aspx)in an open source Apache 2 license (Apache2 is not in the same league as BSD and MIT. It includes an explicit patents grant, versus GPL v2 which doesn't.).

Digest that for a little while ... take some more time to savor it.

With the [Microsoft Community Promise](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2009/Jul-06.html), the Oracle-Java debacle - I see F# as a superb, high performance language usable on both Linux(Mono) and Windows. I'm just waiting for someone to invent a _F# on Fenders _(notice the, poor, Ruby on Rails allegory).

First Windows 7 and now this .... suddenly, Microsoft doesnt look like Mordor anymore ;)
