Two cool statistics coming up:



	
  * McKinsey's innovation bubble-map(dont you love 'em cool visualizations?) ranked by number of patents granted

Of course now, let us all join the chorus into arguing theÂ  innovation involved in OneClick patents. Let us also observe that India and China are nowhere to be found - product innovation vs process innovation FTW.



	
  * Companies with best pay packages:(Gigaom's Malik came up with these brilliant stats)

Synopsys? Xilinx? Well EDA and FPGA are sure nice places to retire - as I have always maintained EDA is a highly incestuous industry. I wouldnt be surprised if these pay-scales at Synopsys and Xilinx are due to cross-pollination of engineering staff.
