title: SteamOS is here - my prediction came true

Almost a year back, I had [predicted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3888472) and [requested](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-2009) that Valve consider building an entire distro on top of Linux, and with it the ability to armtwist nVidia and ATI to build great driver support in Linux.

**Update (Sep 24, 2013)**: Well, that day is here - Valve just announced [SteamOS](http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS/) - a completely new distro built on top of Linux, however with a few improvements.


<blockquote>In SteamOS, we have achieved significant performance increases in graphics processing, and weâ€™re now targeting audio performance and reductions in input latency at the operating system level.</blockquote>


This is going to be huge in the Linux world - the base OS that Valve builds will undoubtedly come with its standardized libraries, driver support and third party hardware support. That could potentially be used a foundation to build a desktop OS as well that could well disrupt the market.

Oh, and the first casualty is already here. Welcome [nVidia ](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/nvidia-seeks-peace-with-linux-pledges-help-on-open-source-driver/)- they have begun to work with the Nouveau open source graphics drivers.


<blockquote>NVIDIA is releasing public documentation on certain aspects of our GPUs, with the intent to address areas that impact the out-of-the-box usability of NVIDIA GPUs with Nouveau. We intend to provide more documentation over time, and guidance in additional areas as we are able.</blockquote>
