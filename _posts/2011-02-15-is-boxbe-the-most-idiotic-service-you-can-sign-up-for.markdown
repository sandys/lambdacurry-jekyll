We have some great intern openings at Clearsenses, and I am reviewing several applications from prospective interns. I sent a mail to one of them asking for further clarifications and this is what I get as a reply:


<blockquote>Hello Sandeep Srinivasa,

I use Boxbe to prioritize my email. While I did receive your email about "internship at Clearsenses", you are not currently listed in my priority Guest List.

**Click here to be added**

Once added, future messages you send will go directly to my Inbox.

Thank you,

Is'nt that beyond moronic to be sending to recruiters, business partners, etc. ? I can understand if Bill Gates uses this, but for ordinary mortals like us who need to be fishing constantly for opportunities.
