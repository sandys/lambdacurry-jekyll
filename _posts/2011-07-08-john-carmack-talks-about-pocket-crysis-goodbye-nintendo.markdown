oh yeah - this is my favorite topic. I have written [about](http://www.lambdacurry.com/2011/02/17/when-can-i-have-some-crysis-love-on-my-quad-core-tegra-android-phone/) [it](http://www.lambdacurry.com/2011/02/03/is-the-motorola-atrix-and-android-the-future-of-personal-computing-both-mobile-and-desktop/) so many times that I am practically salivating.

My current MyTouch 4G will undergo an upgrade when something like the nVidia Kal -El is able to run PS3 equivalent graphics (through an HDMI cable) on my full HD TV.

The surprising thing is - of the triumvirate of gaming consoles (Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo), only Nintendo doesnt have a mobile play.

Big, big mistake...
