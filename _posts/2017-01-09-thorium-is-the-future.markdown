title: Thorium is the future of energy in India
---

Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) or Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTR) are a very old technology that was never built to its potential in the United States for a single reason -
the US does not have the reserves of thorium needed to make this technology productive.

But India has the world's largest reserves of thorium.

Peter Theil has invested in [Transatomic Power](http://www.transatomicpower.com/the-science/) with its [whitepaper](http://www.transatomicpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TAP-White-Paper-v2.1.pdf)
Additionally, China has invested a billion dollars in molten salt reactors headed by the son of [Jiang Zemin](http://www.zdnet.com/article/son-of-chinas-ex-president-thorium-will-help-shape-countrys-energy-future/) (which is as high an endorsement as you can get). 

The problem is that the tech is still 15 years away - US has stopped working on it because of the public scare... plus the current administration is looking to move away from "clean energy" and go back to oil. This is tech that the US wants someone to take off their hands ... because they dont see themselves using it in the next 10-20 years. They are racing directly for fusion. 

China is leveraging this and [getting the US](http://fortune.com/2015/02/02/doe-china-molten-salt-nuclear-reactor/) to help them with tech. 

We are doing some [hand-waving study in MSR](https://southasianvoices.org/indias-venture-into-molten-salt-reactors/) ... but definitely not at the level of china. Not a billion dollars worth. 

The problem is, I think, commercial - India is being sold large conventional reactors for billions of dollars (which will anyways take 10 years to execute). Everybody wants to stop talk about this. 
Plus, NYT recently came up with an article about the necessity for [nuclear power to curb global warming](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/opinion/to-slow-global-warming-we-need-nuclear-power.html). MSR is not nuclear energy like Fukushima or Chernobyl ... but a very clean and safe alternative.

The future is atomic power. But not conventional. For India - it has to MSR.
