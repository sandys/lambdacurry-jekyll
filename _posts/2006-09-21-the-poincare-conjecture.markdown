At first there was [Poincare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincaré)  

He begat [The Conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincaré_conjecture)




Which grew into a dirty [fight](http://science.slashdot.org/science/06/09/21/1442239.shtml) because of attempts to [grab](http://www.newyorker.com/printables/fact/060828fa_fact2) the fruits of [The One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman)'s labor.  

[  

](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincaré)On a more humorless note, I'm trying to follow James Tauber's incredible [blog,](http://jtauber.com/poincare_project) on a layman's attempt to decipher the Poincare Conjecture.




Really, really interesting.
