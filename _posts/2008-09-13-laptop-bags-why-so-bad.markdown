I dont get it - there are hundreds of laptop bags, made from exotic materials, and most of them have like this teeny strap covering the top of the laptop. The whole point in getting a backpack, as opposed to slipping it inside my grocery bag was **protection.**Â But the booming business in laptop-sleeves, which incidentally are touted by many of the same manufacturers, probably are the reason for substandard protection.

I have witnessed multiple people undergo "backpack malfunction" with their laptops. I have a [Pakuma backpack](http://www.hexus.net/content/item.php?item=3874&page=4) which I bought two years back and it has survived India ... Need I say more?

Would it kill more bag manufacturers to have a thick **all-around **padding and just forget about the ipod holder for a while
