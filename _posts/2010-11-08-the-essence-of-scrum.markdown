I read this somewhere:


<blockquote>For mid-size software projects (10-30 person weeks) I would recommend a scrum-like approach, where you collect the main requirements at the beginning, decompose these requirements into manageable pieces, attach estimates/prices to those pieces and decide together with the customer what should be done in the first 2 weeks.

After 2 weeks (the first sprint) you show your results to the customer, agree on whether your tasks are done or what is still missing and what should be done in the next 2 weeks.. and so on..</blockquote>


I enforce scrum internally, but usually our external contractual obligations do not work like this. Primarily because customers want a much more definite predictability on expense.

We do have long term customers who trust us, but even for them we need to give a close enough estimate of man hours (effectively translated into billing).

The question is - has scrum become commonplace enough to be incorporated into standardized management practices ?

I doubt it.
