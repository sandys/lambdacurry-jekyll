There's a lot of things that are wrong with OpenOffice (slow, clunky interface, Java...) but there are more than enough things that are right.

Finally Libreoffice has been forked off to take the ODF based software suite in the direction it was intended.

I'm planning on supporting it by donating to its dev fund - document creation is the most atomic of all knowledge creation activities and it should be free and high quality.
