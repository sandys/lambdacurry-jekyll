This setup eliminates most of the services that will slow down your system (like the _**synaptic**_ cache generation utility, etc.) and also remove _**nautilus**_ (which consumes a shit load of resources) and replace it with **nemo**** **and replace _**gedit **_with **geany**. This means you will lose the **ubuntu-desktop** package.. but it wont hurt you.

Most importantly, this will replace _**Unity**_** **with _**Gnome**_** Shell **(for performance), but I just love the flexibility of [extensions.gnome.org](http://extensions.gnome.org) to miss it.

This setup should take less than 400 mb RAM on startup.
