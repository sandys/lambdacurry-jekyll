Sandeep Srinivasa currently tried to build great engineering and product teams in the online web and ecommerce space.

He was previously part of several startups in the Delhi NCR area.

He previously worked in the Enterprise Software industry - where he tried to squeeze distributed computing technologies into a corporate workspace.

Previously he worked on Research and Development in the EDA industry focussing on timing-analysis, synthesis and most recently, power optimizationÂ  methodologies. In that vein, he is heavily involved in software, algorithms and flow development. Sometimes, he also tries to work with customers to get their problems solved in time for Christmas.

He was employed as Senior Member of Technical Staff @ Calypto Design Systems in the _PowerPro _group.

Prior to Calypto, he was employed as Lead Engineer at SpyGlass Constraints @ Atrenta working on constraints and timing closure rules.

Before Atrenta he was alternatively trying to battle panthers at IIT Bombay and bad Swiss accents at USI-Lugano.

In his spare time, SSS enjoys Muay Thai, deadlifts and World of Warcraft. He recently discovered his love for a mobile gaming on Android.
