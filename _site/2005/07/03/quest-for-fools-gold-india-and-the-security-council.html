    <p>With events in India’s diplomatic circles reaching a silent crescendo (seems like an oxymoron..but that’s how cloak-and-dagger it is), India’s <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1158111.cms">quest</a> <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/5922_1419382,0015002100000000.htm">for</a> a permanent seat at the security council has reached a new sense of <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2005-07-03T071502Z_01_MCC326055_RTRUKOC_0_AFRICA-UN-COUNCIL.xml">urgency</a>.</p>

<p>Is this all that necessary?</p>

<p>For one, since the United States <a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/reform/cluster1/2005/0610hurdles.htm">crippled </a>the status of the new members, by refusing to grant them the veto privelege, the G-4 (as India, Japan, Brazil and Germany are known) have accepted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite">fool’s gold</a>. As it stands now, of the G-4 countries India is the one country that can provide a security, economic and political counterbalance to the Chinese influence in the South-Asian region. Japan - being dependent on the US for its security, Germany - which had better resolve the EU  constitutional crisis before flailing elsewhere, Brazil - a relative newcomer to global political innuendoes are not going to stand as an effective counterbalance to the sphere of Chinese influence.</p>

<p>Though China recognises that, in light of increasing Indo-US ties (helped in no small part by the highly influential expatriate Indian caucus in the US), it had better <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/NewsAnalysis/2005-04-19-voa30.cfm">maintain </a>growing trade and economic ties with India. Similarly, we recognise the need to forge strong economic bonds with China and the <a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/07/01/stories/2005070103321100.htm">ASEAN</a>.</p>

<p>As it stands, India is the country which has consistently opposed the United States on issues that appear to be skewed - be it the CTBT, <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/main/homepagenews/bak2005jun14.htm">patent reforms</a> and Iraq. As the only democratic rising power in the Asian region, it has the potential (as yet to be exercised - a case in note would be our silence to the Taiwan issue, with whom we still do not diplomatic ties) to chill the fire of the Dragon’s breath.</p>

<p>However, it is moot whether or not a permanent seat can help in doing this. A permanent seat is a recognition of power, rather than a seal of approval to exercise it. Can India, which has not opposed China on many issues (other than the venerable Dalai Lama), can do what it could not earlier? I believe that a permanent seat without the veto option is just a permanent seat-warmer with the option to talk out loud.</p>

<p>For me, I think the Indian govt. should pursue the idea of the Ruan - a unified currency for south-asia along with creation of a Free Trade Area (a’la EU). That would be much more effective than a frikking permanent seat.</p>
