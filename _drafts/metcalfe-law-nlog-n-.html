<p>John's post links to an IEEE online paper about how Metcalfe's law may not be correct after all - and they put across the magic number <i>nlog(n)</p>
<p></i>However, I feel that in <strong>lots </strong>of networks the growth is <strong>log(n)</strong></p>
<p>Take social networking for example: if there is you and your friend "<strong>A"</strong>, then the value of the network for you is nada, zilch, shunya<br />
<i><br />
</i>However, if you bring along a new unknown friend ("<strong>B</strong>") and <strong>A</strong> brings alongÂ unknown ("<strong>C</strong>") - now suddenly the value of the network is  <i></p>
<p></i></p>
